The data definitely shows the inequalities in our system.
I think this is especially true of the police shooting data.
The positive coefficient of unarmed police shootings to African Americans
especially demonstrates this.

Overall the redesign process went well but it was definitely
challenging to implement the visitor design pattern.
It was also hard to implement the stats tools because we had to change a
lot of our data to correct the output.
